**weAR it** is an augmented reality application that revolutionizes the way we shop for clothing. By leveraging advanced technologies such as Unity Game Engine and MediaPipe, this app allows users to virtually try on clothing using their smartphone camera. With high-quality graphics, accurate tracking, and an intuitive user interface, weAR it offers a unique and interactive shopping experience.

## Abstract

The weAR it app utilizes Unity Game Engine for developing the user interface, providing stunning visuals, and creating an immersive environment for virtual clothing try-on. MediaPipe, a real-time data processing framework, is employed to process media streams such as video and audio, enabling precise object tracking and mapping in augmented reality. One of the key advantages of using MediaPipe is its compatibility with various cameras, including low-resolution ones, without requiring special hardware or expensive devices.

## Motivation

Traditional shopping can be a frustrating and time-consuming experience, with long queues, crowded stores, and limited availability of sizes and styles. Additionally, online shopping poses its own challenges, as customers cannot try on the clothing before making a purchase, often resulting in the inconvenience of returning items. The motivation behind creating weAR it is to enhance the shopping experience for customers and provide a platform for designers and businesses to market their clothing in an innovative way.

## Use Cases

weAR it caters to a variety of use cases, benefiting both the clothing and fashion industry and individual users:

- **Clothing and Fashion Industry**: Designers and businesses can upload their clothing designs to the app, allowing customers to try them on virtually. This interactive shopping experience opens up new possibilities for showcasing fashion and increases customer engagement.

- **Personal Styling**: Users can leverage weAR it to experiment with different clothing styles and combinations, enabling them to find their perfect outfit without the need for physical try-ons.

- **Social Sharing**: weAR it enables users to share their virtual try-on sessions with friends and family on social media platforms. This not only facilitates social interactions but also serves as a marketing tool for designers and businesses.

- **Sustainability**: By reducing the need for shipping and returns, weAR it contributes to the efforts in reducing the carbon footprint associated with the clothing industry.

## Methodology

The development of weAR it involves the following methodologies:

1. **Unity Game Engine**: Utilizing Unity allows us to create a visually appealing and immersive user interface. The high-quality graphics and visualization capabilities enhance the overall virtual try-on experience.

2. **MediaPipe**: We leverage MediaPipe, a real-time data processing framework, for accurate tracking and mapping of clothing items in augmented reality. MediaPipe's versatility in working with different cameras, including lower-resolution ones, makes it accessible to a wide range of users.
