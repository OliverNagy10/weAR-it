Abstract
Methodology
The methodology behind the development of this wear it  involves the use of advanced technologies such as Unity Game Engine and MediaPipe.  Unity is used for developing the user interface of the app, providing high-quality graphics and visualization capabilities.  MediaPipe is used for real-time data processing of media streams such as video and audio, allowing for accurate tracking and mapping of objects in augmented reality.  The main advantage of using Mediapipe is that it doesnt need special hardware or an expensive device. It can use any camera even low resultion ones.      
Motivation
 The motivation behind creating this project is to improve the shopping experience for customers and to provide a unique platform for designers and businesses to market their clothing in an innovative way.   Traditional shopping can be a stressful and time-consuming experience, with long lines, crowded stores, and limited availability of sizes and styles. With the rise of online shopping, customers are faced with the challenge of making purchases without the ability to see how the clothing would look on them , leading to the frustration of returning items.  
USE CASES
  Clothing and fashion industry: designers and businesses can upload their clothing designs to the app for customers to try on virtually, providing a unique and interactive shopping experience.  Personal styling: customers can use the app to try on different styles and combinations of clothing, allowing them to experiment with different looks and find the perfect outfit.  Social sharing: customers can share their virtual try-on sessions with friends and family on social media, providing a new form of social interaction and marketing for designers and businesses.  Sustainability: the app can help reduce the carbon footprint associated with shipping
